My name is Ron Woodward
My objective is to explore the ways to move people and cargo as efficiently as possible
To do that we need to make use of natural phenomena that contribute to that objective.
A vehicle that flies in ground effect (GEV) requires less energy than an equivelant size aeroplane.
It experiences less drag than an equivalent size ship.
The task therefore is to find the most aerodynamically efficient GEV 
Lift is facilitated by maintaining the vehicle in ground effec.
Drag isminimised by inducing laminar flow, and venturi effects in accordance with the Coanda effect and Bernoulli's principles.
